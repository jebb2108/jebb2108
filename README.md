- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name's Gabriel Bouchard. I was born in Canada, 2002, and have got a duel citizenship.
- I`m striving to be consistent in getting work done. A lot of things I achived just being persuasive in my life.
- Also interested in web-developing. I speak Russian and English pretty fluently, too. In my spare time, I love playing chess for fun.
- Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and deeper concepts of OOP programming.
- My goal is getting better as much as I can in understanding a digital world.
