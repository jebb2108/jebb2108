- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name's Gabriel Bouchard. 22 years old
- I`m striving to be consistent in getting work done. A lot of things I achived just being persuasive in my life.
- Also interested in web-developing. I speak Russian and English pretty fluently, too. In my spare time, I love playing chess for fun.
- Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and deeper concepts of OOP programming.
- My goal is getting better as much as I can in understanding a digital world.
- Feel free to contact me at: gabouchard2002@gmail.com 
- My CodeWars solutions link: https://www.codewars.com/users/jebb2108/completed_solutions
- In addition to what was said, I also have got a Canadian diploma in English, so I'm able to confidently read all the documentation needed in the industry.
