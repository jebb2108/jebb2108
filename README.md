ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name's Gabriel Bouchard. I was born in Canada, 2002, and have got a duel citizenship.
I`m striving to be helpfull and knowladgable as well as respectfull to my peers.
Also interested in web-developing. I speak Russian and English pretty fluently, too. In my spare time, I love playing chess for fun.
Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and the deeper concepts of OOP programming.
My goal of the life is find myself into web development or anything related to soft engeneering, really.
ðŸ“« The contacts you could reach me at are: gabouchard2002@gmail.com & @jebb_king1 telegram
Fun fact: My first language was English after I got to Russia in which I grew up later on.
